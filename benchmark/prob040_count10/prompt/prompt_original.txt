count10:Implement a module named TopModule with the following interface:

- input  clk
- input  reset
- output reg [3:0] q

The module implements a decade counter that cycles from 0 to 9.
All state transitions occur on the positive edge of clk.
The reset signal is active-high and synchronous.

Optimize the design for performance:
- Minimize the combinational logic depth in the clock-to-q path.
- Keep comparisons and arithmetic simple and fast.
- Favor designs that allow higher clock frequency.

Do not modify the module interface or functional behavior.
