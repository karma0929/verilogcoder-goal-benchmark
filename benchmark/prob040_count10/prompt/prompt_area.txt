count10: Implement a module named TopModule with the following interface:
- input  clk
- input  reset
- output reg [3:0] q

The module implements a decade counter that cycles from 0 to 9.
All state transitions occur on the positive edge of clk.
The reset signal is active-high and synchronous.

Optimize the design for minimum area (fewest logic resources):
- Use the most compact state encoding; standard binary encoding (4-bit) is preferred
  unless a smaller encoding demonstrably reduces total gate count.
- Share logic between next-state computation and terminal-count detection wherever possible.
- Avoid redundant flip-flops, unnecessary intermediate signals, or over-specified case statements.
- Express the reset-to-zero and wrap-around (9→0) conditions using shared hardware rather
  than separate logic cones.
- Do not instantiate any unnecessary modules or generate unused signals.

Do not modify the module interface or functional behavior.
