Problem:
Implement a module named TopModule.

Interface:
- input  in  (255 bits)
- output out (8 bits or sufficient width to represent the population count)

Functionality:
The module should count the number of '1' bits in the 255-bit input vector.

Constraints / Area Optimization Goals:
- Optimize for minimal logic area.
- Favor simple, flat combinational logic.
- Reuse intermediate results where possible.
- Avoid deep adder trees or highly parallel structures.
- Sequential logic is NOT allowed; implement purely combinational logic.
- Do not introduce unnecessary wires or temporary signals.

Guidance:
- A linear accumulation or simple reduction approach is acceptable.
- Prioritize reducing total gate count over speed.

Deliverable:
Provide a synthesizable SystemVerilog implementation of TopModule.
Only include the TopModule definition.
