Problem:
Implement a module named TopModule.

Interface:
- input  in  (255 bits)
- output out (8 bits or sufficient width to represent the population count)

Functionality:
The module should count the number of '1' bits in the 255-bit input vector.

Constraints / Power Optimization Goals:
- Optimize for low switching activity and reduced dynamic power.
- Avoid unnecessary signal toggling.
- Prefer conditional accumulation or segmented computation.
- Reduce simultaneous switching of large logic blocks.
- Sequential logic is NOT allowed; implement purely combinational logic.

Guidance:
- Structure the logic to minimize switching when inputs change sparsely.
- Conditional or staged accumulation is preferred over full parallel trees.
- Avoid wide fan-in logic where possible.

Deliverable:
Provide a synthesizable SystemVerilog implementation of TopModule.
Only include the TopModule definition.
