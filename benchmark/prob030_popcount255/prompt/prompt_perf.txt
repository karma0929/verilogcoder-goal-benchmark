Problem:
Implement a module named TopModule.

Interface:
- input  in  (255 bits)
- output out (8 bits or sufficient width to represent the population count)

Functionality:
The module should count the number of '1' bits in the 255-bit input vector.

Constraints / Performance Optimization Goals:
- Optimize for high performance and low logic depth.
- Minimize the critical path.
- Use parallelism aggressively.
- Prefer balanced adder trees over linear accumulation.
- Sequential logic is NOT allowed; implement purely combinational logic.

Guidance:
- Use a tree-based reduction structure.
- Split the input vector into groups and sum them hierarchically.
- Avoid long carry chains where possible.

Deliverable:
Provide a synthesizable SystemVerilog implementation of TopModule.
Only include the TopModule definition.
